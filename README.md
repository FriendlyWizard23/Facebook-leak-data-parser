# Facebook-leak-data-parser
This simple script has the main purpose of helping people check if their data has been leaked during the facebook data leak of 2021 (https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?IR=T)
I decided to write this script because a lot of people kept asking to check for their information because they didn't know how to do it.
Now everybody is able to find out either or not their data has been leaked with a simple command line interface.

### Instalation
There is no installation required, the only thing you need to do is to create a file named "filelist.txt" in the same folder of the fbparser.py (or you can change the variable value inside the program if you wish to put that file in another folder). in this file you will have to write the facebook data files (in txt) location in your computer
As an example, a "filelist.txt" file could be this:
              italy.txt
              usa.txt
              india.txt
              ...
after doing this, the script is ready to start, the rest is self explained by the CLI.

### Disclaimer
this script is a PARSER ONLY which means that it DOES NOT contain any data leak itself (i  do not provide the leaked files).
The purpose of this program is to check for information of people who AUTHORIZED you to do so, you should never seek for information of people who did no authorize you to.
